  "description": "The bakery is a long building, with a small counter adjacent to the closed window that would otherwise serve to sell breads to the people on the street. Behind the counter, you can discern a long wooden table on which the breads are kneaded. The back of the building is dominated by a large round oven, with the openings shielded to keep the inside temperature as constant as possible.",
